        <h2>1. Purpose and Scope</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this Refund Policy is to establish transparent, fair, and consistent procedures for handling refund requests related to all business transactions carried out by Code Bell (PVT) LTD (“the Company”). It defines the rights and responsibilities of both the Company and its clients (“Customers”) with respect to refunds arising from cancelled, discontinued, or altered projects.</p>
        <p>This policy ensures that Customers are informed about the financial implications of cancellation decisions and that all refund processes are handled in a lawful, accountable, and timely manner. It also protects the Company from financial loss resulting from work already completed, expenses incurred, or third-party commitments made during the course of a project.</p>
        <p>The policy applies to all professional and creative services rendered by the Company, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Software and application development (web, mobile, or desktop systems)</li>
            <li>Website design, hosting, and maintenance services</li>
            <li>Digital marketing and advertising campaigns</li>
            <li>Graphic design, branding, and promotional content creation</li>
            <li>Consultation, system analysis, and project management services</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All Customers who confirm a quotation, proposal, or make an advance payment to Code Bell (PVT) LTD are deemed to have read, understood, and agreed to comply with this Refund Policy and its associated terms.</p>

        <h2>2. Refund Scenarios</h2>

        <h3>Case 1: Project Cancelled or Discontinued by the Company</h3>
        <h4>1. Partial Refund for Initiated Projects</h4>
        <p>In certain circumstances, Code Bell (PVT) LTD (“the Company”) may determine that a project must be cancelled, postponed, or permanently discontinued due to internal business decisions, unforeseen technical or financial challenges, or external factors beyond its reasonable control. In such an event, the Company remains committed to maintaining fairness and transparency in its refund process.</p>
        <p>If the project has already commenced and measurable progress has been made at the time of cancellation, the Customer shall be eligible for a partial refund equal to fifty percent (50%) of the advance payment, after deducting the value of the work already performed or expenses incurred by the Company.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this deduction is to ensure that costs already invested into the project—such as labour, materials, third-party services, and administrative processing—are appropriately recognized and accounted for. The Company will make a good-faith assessment of all such expenditures before determining the final refundable amount.</p>
        <p>Deductions may include, but are not limited to, the following categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Software or design development work that has been initiated, tested, or partially completed.</li>
            <li>Marketing and advertising efforts, including campaign setup, promotional content creation, and paid media placements.</li>
            <li>Procurement of third-party services, such as domain registrations, hosting fees, software licenses, or API subscriptions.</li>
            <li>Operational or consultation costs, covering strategic planning, communication, client meetings, and administrative tasks necessary for project execution.</li>
            <li>Any other project-related expense directly tied to the scope of the agreed proposal or quotation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All deductions will be clearly itemized and explained in an official invoice or refund statement issued by the Company. This document will transparently display both the total advance received and all relevant deductions leading to the final refund calculation.</p>
        <p class="formula">Refund Amount = (50% of Advance Payment) – (Total Cost of Work Completed or Expenses Incurred)</p>
        <p>The remaining refund amount, after all applicable deductions, will be processed and deposited into the Customer’s designated bank account within the period defined under Section 3 (Refund Processing Time) of this policy.</p>

        <h4>2. Refund for Non-Initiated Projects</h4>
        <p>In certain instances, Code Bell (PVT) LTD (“the Company”) may decide to cancel, postpone, or discontinue a project prior to its commencement. This may occur due to changes in company operations, technical limitations, unavailability of required resources, mutual agreement with the Customer, or other unforeseen business circumstances.</p>
        <p>When such a decision is made before any development or project-related work has begun, the Customer shall be entitled to a refund amounting to fifty percent (50%) of the advance payment made at the time of project confirmation. This policy ensures fair compensation to the Customer while also allowing the Company to recover partial administrative and planning expenses incurred during project initiation stages.</p>
        <p>The determination of whether a project is considered “non-initiated” will be based on the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No development, design, or creative production work has been performed.</li>
            <li>No marketing, advertising, or campaign activities have been launched.</li>
            <li>No third-party tools, platforms, or subscriptions have been purchased or assigned to the project.</li>
            <li>The project has not been scheduled or assigned to internal teams or contractors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In such cases, the Company will prepare a refund confirmation statement summarizing the project’s status and confirming that no tangible work has been initiated. The Customer will then receive the approved refund amount directly via bank transfer or other officially recognized payment method within the standard refund timeline defined under Section 3 (Refund Processing Time) of this policy.</p>
        <p class="formula">Refund Amount = 50% of Advance Payment</p>

        <h3>Case 2: Project Cancelled or Discontinued by the Customer</h3>
        <h4>1. Cancellation Within 10 Days of Quotation Issue</h4>
        <p>If a Customer chooses to cancel or discontinue a project after accepting a quotation or proposal issued by Code Bell (PVT) LTD (“the Company”), such cancellation must be communicated in writing via email or an official letter to the Company’s authorized representative.</p>
        <p>When a cancellation request is received within ten (10) calendar days from the date the quotation was originally issued, the Customer shall be eligible for a refund amounting to seventy-five percent (75%) of the advance payment made toward the project.</p>
        <p>This clause recognizes that minimal operational or administrative work may have been initiated during the early planning period but ensures that the Customer is substantially reimbursed if the project has not significantly progressed. The remaining twenty-five percent (25%) of the advance payment will be retained by the Company to cover preliminary business costs, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Administrative and quotation preparation expenses</li>
            <li>Resource scheduling or preliminary project planning</li>
            <li>Consultation or correspondence related to proposal customization</li>
            <li>Any transaction or bank processing fees associated with payment receipt</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To qualify for this refund, the Customer must not have received any deliverables, designs, drafts, or partial work from the Company at the time of the cancellation request. If any such materials have been produced and shared, the Company reserves the right to evaluate the extent of the work completed and adjust the refund amount accordingly.</p>
        <p class="formula">Refund Amount = 75% of Advance Payment</p>

        <h4>2. Cancellation After 10 Days of Quotation Issue</h4>
        <p>If a Customer decides to cancel or discontinue a project after ten (10) calendar days from the date the quotation was issued by Code Bell (PVT) LTD (“the Company”), the Customer shall be entitled to a refund amounting to twenty-five percent (25%) of the advance payment made toward the project.</p>
        <p>This policy reflects the fact that, by this stage, the Company may have already initiated key project preparation or execution activities, reserved professional resources, or incurred certain operational costs. These may include time spent on planning, communication, scheduling, design concepts, or other administrative and creative efforts associated with the approved project scope.</p>
        <p>The remaining seventy-five percent (75%) of the advance payment will therefore be retained by the Company to recover such legitimate business expenditures and the opportunity cost associated with resource allocation and project scheduling.</p>
        <p>Examples of activities and costs that may have been incurred include but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Initial design, development, or configuration work performed by assigned teams.</li>
            <li>Preparation of documentation, timelines, and technical specifications.</li>
            <li>Coordination with third-party vendors, service providers, or advertising platforms.</li>
            <li>Internal resource booking, software licensing, or operational planning related to the project.</li>
            <li>Administrative processing and client communication expenses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All cancellation requests made after ten (10) days must be submitted formally in writing through the Customer’s registered communication channel with the Company. Upon receiving such a request, the Company will review the project’s current status and provide the Customer with a refund statement confirming the refundable amount, calculated in accordance with this policy.</p>
        <p class="formula">Refund Amount = 25% of Advance Payment</p>

        <h2>3. Refund Processing Time</h2>
        <p>All refunds approved under this policy will be handled by Code Bell (PVT) LTD (“the Company”) in a transparent and accountable manner. Once a refund request is reviewed and formally approved, the Company will issue a refund confirmation notice to the Customer via the official communication channel (email or letter). This notice will include the refund amount, calculation details, and expected processing period.</p>
        <p>Following the confirmation date, the Company will initiate the necessary financial procedures to process the refund. All refunds will be deposited directly into the Customer’s designated bank account or through another secure payment method agreed upon in writing between both parties.</p>
        <p>Refunds are typically completed within forty-five (45) bank working days from the date of refund confirmation. However, the exact timeframe may vary depending on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The processing time of the Customer’s financial institution or bank.</li>
            <li>Delays caused by public holidays or non-working days.</li>
            <li>Additional verifications required for international or third-party payment gateways.</li>
            <li>Administrative reviews or documentation required to finalize the refund.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Company shall not be held liable for delays resulting from circumstances beyond its control, including but not limited to banking network issues, regulatory reviews, or incomplete account information provided by the Customer.</p>
        <p>Customers are encouraged to ensure that accurate and complete banking details are provided at the time of refund confirmation to facilitate timely processing.</p>
        <p>Once the refund has been successfully processed, the Customer will receive a final Refund Completion Notice confirming the transaction and payment details for recordkeeping purposes.</p>
        <p>This process ensures that all refunds are conducted fairly, securely, and in compliance with the Company’s financial governance standards.</p>

        <h2>4. Non-Refundable Conditions</h2>
        <p>Certain circumstances and conditions render payments non-refundable, as they involve completed deliverables, third-party commitments, or breaches of contract caused by the Customer. To ensure transparency and fairness, Code Bell (PVT) LTD (“the Company”) defines below the cases in which refund claims shall not be applicable or entertained under this policy.</p>
        <p>Refunds will not be issued under the following conditions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Completed and Delivered Projects</strong>
                <p>Once a project, service, or deliverable has been fully completed, tested, and delivered to the Customer in accordance with the agreed scope or contract, the advance payment and any subsequent fees shall become non-refundable. The Company’s obligation is considered fulfilled upon delivery, regardless of whether the Customer chooses to implement or continue using the provided product or service.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Service Charges</strong>
                <p>Any costs or payments made by the Company to third-party vendors or platforms on behalf of the Customer—such as domain registrations, hosting fees, software licenses, marketing ad spend, or third-party integrations—are non-refundable once such services have been purchased, activated, or utilized.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Customer Breach or Delay</strong>
                <p>Refunds will not be granted in cases where the Customer has:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Failed to provide necessary content, approvals, or feedback within the agreed timeline.</li>
                    <li>Breached any contractual or payment terms.</li>
                    <li>Caused unreasonable delay or disruption to project progress.</li>
                    <li>Terminated the agreement without valid grounds as outlined in the signed contract or quotation terms.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Change of Mind or Internal Decision</strong>
                <p>Refunds will not be issued solely on the basis of the Customer’s change of mind, altered business direction, or preference to discontinue after project initiation.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>These conditions exist to ensure fair protection for both parties and to recognize the value of time, effort, and resources invested by the Company in good faith toward project fulfillment.</p>

        <h2>5. Amendments</h2>
        <p>Code Bell (PVT) LTD (“the Company”) reserves the full right to amend, modify, or update this Refund Policy at any time, without prior notice, to reflect changes in business practices, operational procedures, legal requirements, or industry standards.</p>
        <p>Any such amendments will take immediate effect upon publication on the Company’s official website, or upon issuance of written or electronic notification to the Customer through official communication channels, whichever occurs first. Customers are encouraged to review the most recent version of this policy periodically to remain informed of any updates or revisions.</p>
        <p>Continued engagement with the Company—such as proceeding with a quotation, making a payment, or accepting services—after such changes have been published shall constitute the Customer’s acknowledgment and acceptance of the updated policy terms.</p>
        <p>The Company undertakes to ensure that all amendments are made in good faith, maintaining transparency, fairness, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing commercial transactions and service agreements.</p>
        <p>In the event of any inconsistency between previous versions of this Refund Policy and the most recent published version, the latest version shall prevail and be deemed legally binding on all ongoing and future transactions.</p>

        <h2>6. Policy Acceptance and Acknowledgment</h2>
        <p>By entering into a service agreement, accepting a quotation, or making any advance payment to Code Bell (PVT) LTD (“the Company”), the Customer expressly acknowledges that they have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all the terms and conditions set forth in this Refund Policy.</p>
        <p>This acknowledgment confirms that the Customer is aware of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The circumstances under which refunds may or may not be granted, including project initiation, completion, and third-party service expenses.</li>
            <li>The timelines and procedures for processing approved refunds.</li>
            <li>The calculation formulas applied to determine refund amounts in the event of project cancellation or discontinuation.</li>
            <li>The Company’s right to amend, update, or modify this policy at any time, with such amendments becoming effective upon publication.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By providing consent through written, electronic, or verbal confirmation, or by proceeding with payment, the Customer agrees that this Refund Policy forms an integral part of the contractual relationship between the Customer and the Company.</p>
        <p>The Customer further agrees to comply with all obligations outlined herein, including timely communication, provision of necessary approvals, and cooperation during project execution. Any disputes, queries, or concerns regarding refunds should be directed to the Company promptly and in writing.</p>
        <p>This policy is intended to promote transparency, fairness, and mutual accountability, ensuring that both the Company and the Customer have a clear understanding of their respective rights and responsibilities concerning project cancellations, discontinuations, and associated refund processes.</p>
